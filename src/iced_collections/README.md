# Pattern to work with Collections

We are slowly getting deeper and deeper into the Rust, and Iced way of thinking. Try to approach
this chapter as a learning journey. Every part starts with an exercise.

Always first try it yourself. Think about it. Effort, sweat, and yes tears, always pay out in the end. You
will become a better programmer.

> Every bug you face, every compiler error, every stumbling moves you a step closer to mastery.
