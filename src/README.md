# Master Iced by building a Modern UI with Rust and Postgres.

The best way to learn new programming skills is by building something in an iterative way with a constant feedback loop.

Ideally, any code you write should immediately show a result on the screen. This is like a drug that keeps you
interested to continue your learning journey. Most learning ressources on Rust are about either pure theory, or
examples, which are irrelevant and are not ... your interest.

The reason why Javascript, which seems easy to learn, but in fact is very hard to master, so you can write bug-free code
in, is so popular, is because it has this feedback loop built in. You can almost immediately see the result of your code in
a web-browser.

This is where Iced comes in. Iced empowers you to build modern desktop and web applications in 100% Rust. There are no
non-Rust concepts, dark secret magic, HTML or XML. It's all plain Rust. That is why Iced is amazing, not just for building
applications, but also for learning.

Rust is really not that difficult to learn, and Iced makes the journey easier and more fun.

Just like with any other programming language, you will need to learn some syntax,
semantics, grammar and rules along the way.

This book consists of 5 parts.

## Part 1: Theory

In the first part there will be some theory. Yes, you need to get some knowledge before you can start. But it's very limited and easy,
and you will grasp it in just a few hours. I will also point to some online resources along the way.

## Part 2: Building a Login and Registration Form

Then, we will immediately jump into building something useful, that almost all applications need, a registration and a login form. This step will be
mostly to understand how to use the Iced building blocks to create a simple application. Unlike the counter example or other one-screen examples
in the documentation, we will go for a real situation with multiple screens.

You will see that it is super easy, and even fun.

## Part 3: Connecting it to a Postgres database

Once the scaffolding (views, message, ...) are built, we will wire it up with a Postgres database, to make it into a real application.
Along the way you will learn some SQL, SQLX and how to iterate using the sqlx-cli to build Iced applications, which are connected to
databases.

## Part 4: Listening to Keystrokes

## Part 5: Compiling for Web and Desktop
