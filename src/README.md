# Master building Modern UI's with Rust, Iced, SQLX, and Postgres.

The best way to learn new programming skills is by building something in an iterative way with a constant feedback loop.

Ideally, any code you write should immediately show a result on the screen. This is like a drug that keeps you
interested to continue your learning journey. Most learning resources on Rust are either pure theory, or
examples, which are totally irrelevant in your day to day coding work.

If you want to truly master Rust and Iced, you need to start building something. And you will face serious problems along the way.
Your code won't compile. The compiler will complain:). You will have to start looking for a solution. Don't worry. That's normal.
Becoming a master isn't easy. It's hard. But every hurdle you cross, is a step closer to mastery.

The reason why Javascript is so popular, despite being more difficult that Rust in many ways, is simply because you
can see almost immediately what your code does in a web-browser.

This is where Iced comes in. Iced empowers you to build modern desktop and web applications in 100% Rust. There are no
non-Rust concepts, dark secret magic, HTML or XML. It's all plain Rust. All concepts and idioms used are all Rust.
That is why Iced is amazing, not just for building applications, but also for learning.

I want to stress that Rust is really not that difficult to learn, and Iced makes the journey easier and more fun.

Of course, just like with any other programming language, you will need to learn some syntax, semantics, grammar
and rules along the way. But as you will move along that journey you will learn to love Iced and Rust.

This book consists of several parts, and is a work in progres. You can leave your email and you will be notified
when the next chapter and updates are shared.

## Part 1: Theory

In the first part there will be some theory. Yes, you need to get some knowledge before you can start. But it's very limited and easy,
and you will grasp it in just a few hours. I will also point to some online resources along the way.

## Part 2: Building a Login and Registration Form

Then, we will immediately jump into building something useful, that almost all applications need, a registration and a login form. This step will be
mostly to understand how to use the Iced building blocks to create a simple application, without any data written to a database.
Unlike the counter example or other one-screen examples in the documentation, we will go for a real situation with multiple screens and a real layout.

You will see that it is super easy, and even fun to compose Iced building blocks into a real application.

## Part 3: Connecting it to a Postgres database

Once the scaffolding (views, message, ...) are built, we will wire it up with a Postgres database, to make it into a real application.
Along the way you will learn some SQL, SQLX and how to iterate using the sqlx-cli to build Iced applications, which are connected to
databases.
