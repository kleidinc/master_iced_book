# Master Iced by building a Modern UI with Rust and Postgres.

The best way to learn new programming skills is by building something in an iterative way with a constant feedback loop.

Ideally, any code you write should immediately show a result on the screen. This is like a drug that keeps you
interested to continue your learning journey.

This is where Iced comes in. Iced empowers you to build modern desktop and web applications in 100% Rust. There are no
non-Rust concepts or HTML or XML. It's all plain Rust. That is why Iced is amazing not just for building applications,
but also for learning.

Rust is really not that difficult to learn.

Just like with any other programming language, you will need to learn the syntax,
the semantics, the grammar and the patterns.

This book consists of 5 parts.

## Part 1: Theory

In the first part there will be some theory. Yes, you need to get
some knowledge before you can start. But it's very limited and easy,
and you will grasp it in just a few hours.

## Part 2: Building a Login and Registration Form

Then, we will immediately jump into building something that almost all
applications need, a registration and a login form. This step will be
mostly to understand how to use the Iced building blocks to create an
application. Unlike the counter example or other one-screen examples
in the documentation, we will go for a real situation with multiple screens.

## Part 3: Connecting it to a Postgres database

One the scaffolding is built, we will wire it up with a Postgres database,
and the forms will really start to work. You will learn some SQL along the
way, and how to use the SQLX crate and how to iterate building Iced
applications.

## Part 4: Listening to Keystrokes

## Part 5: Compiling for Web and Desktop
