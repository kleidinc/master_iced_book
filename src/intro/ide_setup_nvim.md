# Setting up Development Environment

If you are serious about becoming a coding master, you should use professional tools. You may be surprised to find out that
many coding masters use very lightweight open-source vim-like tools.

I use neovim, with some Rust plugins, which are easy to set-up, and allow me to code in a clutter-free clean
and fully controlled environment, which helps me focus for long periods of time.

There are no easy shortcuts in life. If you want to achieve a high level of mastery, you need to
put in the time and effort.

Just as you would have to learn to drive a racecar in the rain or snow, you need to to learn the neovim
shortcuts, read the docs, learn how to install lua plugings, and how to personalize your neovim.

Just like you would do with Rust, Iced, Postgres, git, SQLX or any of the tools you are going to be using.

Your development environment is by far the most important tool.

# Why Neovim

1. Once you learn the shortcuts, your mouse will become obsolete and your keyboard will become like a part of you.
2. You ca fully customize and control your coding environment.
3. It's open-source, free and not connected to any spy- or bloat-ware.
