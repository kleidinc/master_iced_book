# Setting up Development Environment

## Why your IDE is so important

Times have changed.

Forget about junior, middle and senior levels. These terms were coined when people still used floppy disks, installing
the latest version of MS-DOS. Although these terms are still around, and often used in job descriptions, they
lost all meaning when innovation in tech started to move at speeds which were unthought of in the 1980ies.

Back then, you could learn something, and apply it for the rest of your programming career. In 2025 that is
not the case anymore.

You need to be able to adapt to new technologies, new libraries, new practices, all the time. To do that,
you need a fully customizable, powerful ide, which you can easily expand, change as required.

That is where Neovim comes in. And that is why learning to control and configure your Neovim config is as
important as learning Rust, Iced, SQLx or any new technology you want to master.

### Master Programmer

These days being a succesful programmer you need to learn almost constantly, and most importantly you also
need to forget knowlegde you only learned last year or even 6 months ago. Yesterdays best practices
are tomorrows forgotten bad practices. That's how it is, and it's only going to get worse.

**A master programmer is someone who can adapt fast, learn new skills, forgot old ones, and stay on the
cutting edge.**

If you are serious about becoming a master, you should be serious about the tools you use. Most of them you
will be using for the rest of your career. Or until something better comes along.

### Why I use Neovim alongside Tmux

I use neovim, with some mostly-related Rust plugins, which are easy to set-up, and allow me to code in a
clutter-free clean and fully controlled environment. I often code for hours on end, sometimes forgetting
the time and just remain focussed.

There are no shortcuts in life. If you want to achieve a high level of mastery, you need to
put in the time and effort.

_Just as you would have to learn to drive a racecar, to survive in the rain or snow, you need to to learn the neovim
shortcuts, read the docs, learn how to install lua plugings, and how to personalize your neovim.
But once you master it, you will overtake everyone else who is not using the best tools for the job._

Just like you would do with Rust, Iced, Postgres, git, SQLX or any of the tools you are going to be using.

# Why Neovim

1. Once you learn the shortcuts, your mouse will become obsolete and your keyboard will become like a part of you.
   You will become more proficient and more productive.
2. You can fully customize and control your coding environment.
3. It's open-source, free and not connected to any spy- or bloat-ware. This if often overlooked, but
   in the current time this also becomes important.

# Neovim for Rust

If you never used neovim before, I would suggest not to directly jump to a preconfigured or prebuild
config. It's not about how fast you can start using Neovim, but how you learn to configure it and slowly
become proficient in it.
