# Why Rust

1. As a programmer Rust allows me to write robust code without the memory bugs,
   I would probably make if I would write in another language.

2. It has a thriving open-source community, that rivals the commercially available
   code.

3. It's open source, and can be forked, if needed. So it can't be taken away.
