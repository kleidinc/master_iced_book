# How to learn the right way?

I find it mind boggling that throughout my whole life, while I was in school, high-school
and even in university, no one ever told me how to learn. We had books, lectures,
on how to learn lots of things, except on how to learn to learn.

It's only after I started learning Rust at a 'mature' age, that I tried to understand
how to learn more efficiently. When you learn with a mission you want to optimize, and
speed up the process. It's not about getting the best grade in an exam, but actually
understanding deeply the Rust language, it's idioms, syntax, semantics,
, so it becomes a tool to solve complex problems.

While I was learning Rust, I also immersed myself in memory palaces, mnemonics, staged repetition,
to improve how I learn.

I can't cover everything here. That is not the purpose of this
book, but I can give you some tips, which will improve your learning journey.

### Some Useful Tips

1. First read a book on Rust. After every chapter write down, yes on paper with a pen,
   what new concepts you've read about. Don't write code yet.

2. Then start writing code.The best way to learn is to build something you need from scratch. When you go through
   the process of building, your brain will create more neural pathways between knowledge you
   came across, and the harder it is to build something the better your brain will work.

3. Every compiler error is a way to practice, learn, and apply your earlier learned
   knowledge. Solving serious problems is the best way to learn.

4. Focus on reading books, documentation, and writing code every day.

5. Heavily curate what `video-content` you watch. When watching quality content, do it actively,
   and note down the knowledge you come across, and then add it to your knowledge base.

6. Memorize, practice, and repeat and repeat again. Only then can mastery be achieved.
