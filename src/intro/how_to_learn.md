# How to learn the right way?

I find it mind boggling that throughout my whole life, while I was in school, high-school
and even in university, no one ever told me how to learn. We had books, lectures,
on how to learn lots of things, except on how to learn to learn.

It's only after I started learning Rust at a 'mature' age, that I tried to understand
how to learn more efficiently. When you learn with a mission you want to optimize, and
speed up the process. It's not about getting the best grade in an exam, but actually
understanding deeply the Rust language, it's idioms, syntax, semantics,
, so it becomes a tool to solve complex problems.

I can't cover everything here. That is not the purpose of this book, but I can give you some tips,
which will improve your learning journey.

### Some Useful Tips

1. First read at least one book on Rust. After every chapter take some time, to write down what you
   learned. Yes, you may have to rediscover paper and a pen. Don't start writing code yet. This will
   precondition your brain to open up to Rust, and start building neural pathways for Rust.

2. Then think about what you want to build. Describe it clearly on paper. Make sketches and decide
   which features the minimal first version of the product needs to have. Again, this will create
   a continuous problem-solving mechanism in your brain. You will learn because you have a clear goal.

3. Then start writing code, without snippets, or boiler-plate. Never copy-paste. When you go through
   the process of writing, your brain will create more and more neural pathways between knowledge you
   came across, and force you to learn more knowledge so you can more forward in reaching your goal.
   Always write down new knowledge. Review it regularly. You can even use spaced memory retrieval.

4. The harder it is to build something the better your brain will work. And the better you will become
   at Rust, Iced, and all the tools you will need.

5. Welcome compiler errors. Every compiler error is a way to practice, learn, and apply your earlier learned
   knowledge. Solving serious problems is the best way to learn.

6. Focus on reading books, documentation, and writing code every day.

7. Heavily curate what `video-content` you watch. When watching quality content, do it actively,
   and always note down the knowledge you come across, and then add it to your knowledge base.

8. Memorize, practice, and repeat and repeat again. Only then can mastery be achieved.

9. If you get stuck, go to the Iced discourse, the Rust Lang Forum and ask questions. When asking
   questions, be concise, describe clearly what you want to achieve and show your code. The community
   is very helpful. I did this myself as I was learning.
