# Why Iced

Rust books and learning materials are mostly focused around using Rust,
in cli-tools and terminal applications. But Rust is equally amazing when
building web, and more importantly desktop applications.

But building UI's with Rust, until Iced 0.14, was more for testing, and
experimenting. To build applications, you don't just need a runtime, but
you also need components to compose user interfaces. Iced has both.

And Iced is evolving, more components, read widgets, are coming, but even
now, it can be used to develop full-blown desktop applications.

Iced is clean, in the sense, that if you know Rust, you can easily learn
it. There are some idioms idioms you need to master, but that's all.
