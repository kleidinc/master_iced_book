The best way to learn new programming skills is by building something in an iterative way,
with a constant feedback loop.

Ideally, any code you write should immediately show a result on the screen. This becomes almost like a drug,
that keeps you going forward. Most learning resources on Rust, are either pure theory, or command-line examples.

With Iced, SQLX and Postgres, you can build almost anything in Rust for the desktop and the web.

Sure, you will face serious problems along the way. Your code won't compile. The compiler will complain.
And you will need to start looking for a solution. Don't worry. That's normal.
Becoming a coding master isn't easy. It's hard. But every hurdle you cross, is a step closer to mastery.

The reason why JavaScript is so popular, despite being more difficult than Rust, if you really want to master
it, is simply because you can see almost immediately what your code does in a web-browser.

This is where Iced.rs comes in. Iced empowers you to build modern desktop, and web applications in 100% Rust.
There are no non-Rust concepts, dark secret magic, legacy code no living soul has touched for decades.

It's all plain Rust.
All concepts and idioms used are all Rust.
That is why Iced is amazing, not only for building applications, but more importantly for learning.

Of course, just like with any other programming language, you will need to learn some syntax,
semantics, grammar and rules along the way.

But as you will move along that journey you will learn to love the Rust, Iced, SQLX and Postgres (RISP)
toolkit.

This book is a work in progress.

### Part 1: Intro on Iced

In the first part there will be some theory. Yes, you need to get some knowledge before you can start.
You need to understand the anatomy and architecture of an Iced Application before you start. It is
easy to grasp, and I will point you to some additional resources as well.

### Part 2: Building a Login and Registration Form

Then, we will immediately jump into building something useful, that almost all applications need, a registration and a login form. This step will be
mostly to understand how to use the Iced building blocks to create a simple application, without any data written to a database.
Unlike the counter example or other one-screen examples in the documentation, we will go for a real situation with multiple screens and a real layout.

You will see that it is super easy, and even fun to compose Iced building blocks into a real application.

### Part 3: Connecting it to a Postgres database

Once the scaffolding (views, message, ...) are built, we will wire it up with a Postgres database, to make it into a real application.
Along the way you will learn some SQL, SQLX and how to iterate using the sqlx-cli to build Iced applications, which are connected to
databases.

### Part 4: Listening to Keystrokes

### Part 5: Compiling for Web and Desktop
