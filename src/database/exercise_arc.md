# Exercise: Share a PgPool connection pool in Iced

Before we go further I want you to stop for a moment, and do an exercise.

```rust
fn main() {
    //

}

async fn register_user() {
    //
}
```

## What do you need to achieve?

Set up a shared pool of database connections for your Iced application.

How would you go about achieving this?
