This is not intended as a thourough introduction into SQL. There are many very well written
books and ressources on how to master SQL.

I will however provide the absolute minimum, you need to get you started.

In Rust you always need an extra step when creating tables, you need to think about the
types, and how they will be converted to Rust types.
